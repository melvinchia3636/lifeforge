## 🤔 The Problem

People nowadays having tons of different apps to increase their productivity, but [using too much apps distracts your focus](https://theunfilteredreport.com/why-productivity-apps-are-making-people-less-productive/).

Most software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions are subscription-based, leading to recurring costs that can add up over time. Additionally, many of these services collect user data for advertising or analytics purposes, and even using those data for AI training, raising privacy concerns.

## ✅ The Solution

LifeForge is a **personal management system** designed to help you manage your life efficiently. Whether it's keeping track of tasks, organizing projects, setting personal goals, or managing financial statuses, LifeForge has got you covered.

With its modular architecture, you can customize LifeForge to fit your unique needs. Activate only the modules you require, **keep yourself from a pile of unused features**, and create a streamlined experience tailored just for you.

Built with privacy in mind, your data is stored locally on your own server or device (we do not host any servers too), which means you are in full control of your data. **No telemetry, no data mining, just pure privacy**.

## 🧱 Modules

LifeForge’s modular system is designed to empower users by providing a diverse range of tools and features tailored to their unique needs. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of life, such as productivity, finance, lifestyle, and learning, offering flexibility and customization. Whether you’re organizing your tasks, managing finances, or exploring creative pursuits, LifeForge’s modular design allows you to activate only the features you need, creating a personalized and streamlined experience.

Key highlights of the modules include:

- Productivity Tools: Boost efficiency with modules like the Todo List, Projects, Idea Box, and the Pomodoro Timer. These tools help users manage tasks, brainstorm ideas, and stay focused on their goals.
- Finance Management: Take control of finances using the Wallet, Wishlist, and Budget modules, offering tools for tracking expenses, saving for future goals, and planning budgets.
- Lifestyle Enhancements: Reflect and grow with the Journal and Achievements modules, or stay active with features like Workout tracking.
- Study Aids: Improve learning with the Flashcards, Notes, and CFOP Algorithms modules, ideal for students and lifelong learners.
- Storage Solutions: Organize books, photos, music, and more with modules like Books Library, Photos, and Guitar Tabs.
- Information Management: Stay informed and efficient with tools like the Mail Inbox and Changi Airport for specialized insights.
- Customization: Tailor the platform to individual preferences using the Personalization module for a unique user experience.

The modular approach ensures flexibility and scalability, allowing users to toggle on or off the features they need. Whether you’re a professional, a student, or a hobbyist, the system's diverse modules are designed to fit seamlessly into your lifestyle.

**(The new module system, Forgistry is currently under development and will be released soon!)**
