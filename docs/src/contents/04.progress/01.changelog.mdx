###### Changelog

# Stuff are Rapidly Evolving

LifeForge is not backed by any major corporations or strong team of developers (for now), and it's primarily been worked by a single developer in his spare time. As such, there is no formal SDLC (well, technically speaking this project is adapting Agile methodologies) in place, and things may change rapidly and unexpectedly as new ideas are implemented and tested. However, I'll do my best to try and outline the notable changes and updates in this changelog.

#### Version Naming Conventions

Unlike traditional software development projects which adapt Semantic versioning, LifeForge in its current development phase, opts for a simpler versioning scheme inspired by Minecraft. Each version of LifeForge is identified by the year and week of development, with the following format:

```plaintext
dev <year>w<week>
```
