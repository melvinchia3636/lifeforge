- <Commit hash="bb4854aac82101c23deaa5af78ec01e3dca3a6a2" />: Updated `dev` script for `client` codebase to build `shared` and `lifeforge-ui` packages before starting the development server to avoid potential issues caused by stale or non-existent builds.

- <PR number={51} />, <Commit hash="ada44b82069bc16531c1f70db03b5105d70adb67" />, <Commit hash="994372fe503a6368a3a1626014485e0f7ef6a3f7" />, <Commit hash="f88502018e38884c07c7542407ea24c435d81f42" />: Implemented dynamic language pack loading engine, separating localization files from the main application codebase. User can now add new language support by simply installing the corresponding language pack through

    ```bash
    bun forge locales add <locale-code>
    ```

    For more information, refer to the <a href="/user-guide/localization">localization guide</a>.

- <Commit hash="80c8d308c40eb91884f0abc9850173ede0645cfa" />, <Commit hash="3d8cec06fa72a6355cf2053645d55d29afcdda5f" />: `id` and `collectionId` fields are now removed from the schema when syncing database schema to avoid potential conflicts. Collections and fields are now matched solely based on their names. Completely reworked migration generation logic into a three-stage process to properly handle cross-reference fields.
    - Stage 1: Generate collection skeletons without any fields if the collection does not exist.
    - Stage 2: Add fields and configs for normal collections.
    - Stage 3: Add view-type collections that depend on the existence of specific fields in other collections.

- <PR number={56} />: Renamed database syncing commands:

    ```bash
    # Old commands
    bun forge db generate-schemas
    bun forge db generate-migrations

    # New commands
    bun forge db pull
    bun forge db push
    ```

- <PR number={57} />: Huge rework on the API key management. Master password is now removed from the API key management page since LifeForge API now supports end-to-end asymmetric encryption for every API call, so there is no need to encrypt the API key a second time using the master password.

    <Alert type="important" className="mt-6">
        As long as you keep your `MASTER_KEY` environment variable safe, your API keys are safe even if your database is compromised. So please, <strong>KEEP YOUR MASTER KEY SAFE!</strong>
    </Alert>


- <PR number={57} />, <Commit hash="f1f1cfaa68f960147672600c693fad967c40e756" />, <Commit hash="7d348050bf48de6d54e2a2e5c243467715257fae" />: Moved the `manifest.ts` file from `client` folder of each module to the root folder of each module to facilitate better module management in the future. Improved API keys usage declaration in the manifest file.

    ```ts
    // Old way
    export const manifest: ModuleManifest = {
      ...
      requiredAPIKeys: ['openai', 'tmdb'],
      ...
    };

    // New way
    export const manifest: ModuleManifest = {
      ...
      apiKeyAccess: {
        openai: {
            usage: "Generate text and image content using OpenAI's API",
            required: false,
        },
        tmdb: {
            usage: "Fetch movie and TV show data from The Movie Database",
            required: false,
        },
      },
    };
    ```

- <PR number={57} />: Flattened the `client` folder in each module, moving all client-side code from `client/src` to `client` directly for better structural consistency with the server-side code.

- <PR number={57} />, <Commit hash="3ae47f3a53ca487f66bed94401c4d8b157365a42" />, <Commit hash="2334bca3cab9f84239273883b545c3e4eeda2987" />, <Commit hash="e7700f905a5e807a95f689b8ec6598fd90b8c44e" />, <Commit hash="80c128fbe2ee5dd42a1c020325e09b81f11fa4be" />: Removed description field from API keys record, and the API Key management page now displays how much module is using a particular API key to give users better insights on their API key usage.

Added root name check during server initialization to make sure the project folder name is 'lifeforge'.
