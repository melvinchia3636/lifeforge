### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & Technical Improvements

- Stopped updating CHANGELOG.md, and changes made to the codebase will be documented in the commit messages.
- <Commit hash="057bb8250fec6c4696b6b726039f7344b01c635c" />: Moved task pool
  middleware to socket.io functions folder.

  <Code language="typescript">
    {`import { addToTaskPool, updateTaskInPool } from '@functions/socketio/taskPool'`}
  </Code>

- Rolled back the changes made to the localization manager (the codebase is too complex and difficult to migrate to using React Query, and since it works just fine, it's not worth the effort).
- <Commit hash="66988c3424a7003579cd87a06032b1bbd43d5488" />: Updated repository
  links in documentation and components to reflect new GitHub organization.

- Added typescript definition for font families data returned from Google Fonts API.
