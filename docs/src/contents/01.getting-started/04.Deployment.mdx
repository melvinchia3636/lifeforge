###### Deployment

# Make it Available Anywhere You Go

Now that you have successfully set up your LifeForge system, it's time to deploy it to a server so that you can access it from anywhere. In this guide, I'll show you how to deploy LifeForge to a cloud server using Vercel and Render, but you can also deploy it to any other cloud server that supports Node.js applications.

## Deploying Frontend

Since the frontend is basically just a **Single Page Application (SPA)**, we can easily deploy it to Vercel, Netlify, or maybe even GitHub Pages (never done it before, not sure if it works). Simply import your GitHub repository, select the root directory to point to the `client` folder, and set the build command to `bun run build` and the output directory to `client/dist`.

<Alert className="mt-6" type="warning">
### Bun Version Requirement

When deploying the client application to PaaS providers like Vercel or Netlify, make sure that the Bun version used in the build environment is at least **v1.3.0**, since the dependency resolution mechanism used in Bun v1.3.0 and later is required to properly build the client application. If the Bun version is lower than v1.3.0, your app should still build, but you might run into lots of issues when running the app.

However, as of October 2025, Vercel and Netlify do not yet support Bun v1.3.0 in their build environments. Therefore, you will need to manually configure the installation script to upgrade Bun using the command `bun upgrade` before installing the dependencies.

In Vercel, head to the project settings, and under the **Build & Development Settings** section, override the **Install Command** to the following:

```bash
bun upgrade && bun install --linker isolated
```

As shown in the image below:

However, in Netlify, I can't seem to find a way to override the install command. If you know how to do it, please let me know!

## Deploying Backend

You will eventually need to make your server accessible from the public internet. Therefore, a securely hosted backend server with SSL/TLS encryption is essential to protect your data and ensure secure communication between the client and server. Your client application hosted with https prefix will not be able to communicate with a backend server that is not secured with SSL/TLS encryption after all.

The backend server is a **vanilla Express.JS application**, which means you can deploy it to any cloud server that supports Node.js applications. You can use some sort of Virtual Private Server (VPS) like DigitalOcean, Linode, or even AWS EC2.

### Using a Proxy Server

If you want to save some money and avoid the hassle of setting up a VPS, and you just so happen to have an old computer or a Raspberry Pi lying around, you can also host the backend server on your own local server and use a **proxy server** to redirect the requests to your local server through a secure connection.

Before we start, make sure you have setup the port forwarding on your router to forward the port that your backend API is running on to the public internet. This is necessary for the proxy server to work.

Next, clone the proxy server repository that I have created for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LifeForge-app/lifeforge-api-proxy.git
```

Then, navigate to the `lifeforge-proxy` directory and create a `.env` file. There is only one field that you need to fill in, which is the `TARGET_URL` field. This field is the public URL of your backend API server. Make sure to put the full URL, including the `http(s)://` prefix.

Finally, deploy the proxy server to Render or any other cloud server that supports Node.js applications. Make sure to copy and paste the environment variables from your `.env` file to the server dashboard.

Once the deployment is complete, you should see a link to your proxy server. Try to access your API using the link and see if it works. Make sure to update the `VITE_API_HOST` field in your `.env.local` file to the URL of your proxy server.

## Deploying Database

Well, you can just let the database run on your local server. But if you really want to deploy it to a cloud server, there might be several ways to do it, which I'm not going to cover in this guide.

As for the file storage, Pocketbase provides option for you to store you files in the cloud in the form of an S3 bucket. Head to the Pocketbase settings page and under the File Storage section, you can switch the file storage to S3 and fill in the necessary fields to connect to your S3 bucket.

If you're finding the system not to your liking and you just so happen to be a web developer, you can also create your own modules and contribute to the project.
