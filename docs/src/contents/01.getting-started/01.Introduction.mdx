Before you begin, let's take a look at some background story of this project.

## The Back Story

Back in 2023, towards the end of the year, when I was still sinking into my pool of unfinished little projects, life was... okay, to say the least. But my portfolio, even though it contains dozens of projects, still looks pretty naive as most of the projects being showcased are small to medium sized, and a lot of them doesn't actually serve a real purpose. I hadn't let go of the idea of creating a large project that actually solves a real life problem since then... until that day.

It was just a normal day, lying on my bed after dinner, scrolling through YouTube shorts. It wasn't until I stumbled across a short film showing a scene of a pilot in the cockpit of a commercial airliner that I was taken aback. I was absolutely amazed at the complexity of the cockpit and the fact that the entire plane is controlled by all these buttons and switches in the cockpit. In a split second, I had an idea: what if I created a system that helped me take control of my life, just like the cockpit controls the airplane?

And the rest was history. I started a new project and started spamming code like crazy. Without me realizing it, this project was pushed into production and is now mostly functional and used by myself to manage various aspects of my life.

## The Current Stage

Fast forward almost two years later, the project is still in active development stage. From conception to actual realization, I was mostly on my own the whole time. Despite the difficulties, I had a lot of fun and the feeling of having achieved something. Fortunately, this project is slowly but surely gaining attentions from people around the world. Now, with few contributors joining in to help out with the development, the project is becoming more and more mature. Hopefully in the foreseeable future, there'll be a community of developers built for this project.

This project is built with modularity, meaning that each function is its own separate module. With the modularization mechanism finally in place, it is now possible to add new features to the system without affecting the existing ones. This opens up a lot of possibilities for the future of this project.

## The Future

A good beginning is half done. Now that half is done, i.e. the basis of the system, it is time for the system to become bigger. As the saying goes: many hands make light work. What one can achieve is always limited. If you are reading this documentation and are a web developer, I call on you to contribute to this project. Let us make the system the next Notion, but better!

## Why LifeForge?

Did I just mention notion? The absolute GOAT for personal management? Why should you choose LifeForge instead of Notion? Notion is good, but it has its downsides. Primarily:

- **Open Source vs Closed Source**: First, unlike the completely open sourced LifeForge, it's a closed sourced program, which means you have absolutely no idea what it's doing with your data.
- **Data Control**: With Notion, your data is stored on their servers. You have no control over your data. If they decide to shut down their service, you lose everything. With LifeForge, you can self-host it on your own server or even on your local machine. You have complete control over your data.
- **Too Bloated**: Notion is a very powerful tool, but it is also very bloated. It has a lot of features that you may never use. This can make the user experience overwhelming and confusing. LifeForge, on the other hand, you can choose to install only the modules you need.
- **Paywall**: Notion has a paywall for many of its features. If you want to use the full potential of Notion, you have to pay for it. With LifeForge, you get all the features for free.

Speaking of closed sourced programs, a lot of the downsides mentioned above also apply to other software. With the trend of software becoming more and more subscription-based, people are starting to realize the importance of actually owning their software and data. LifeForge is here to provide an alternative for those who value freedom and control over their digital lives.

## However...

LifeForge is still in its early stages of development. There are still many features that are not yet implemented, and there may be bugs and issues that need to be fixed. If you decide to use LifeForge, please be aware of this and be prepared to encounter some issues along the way. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated to help improve the system.

Also, despite my best efforts to make the system as intuitive as possible, LifeForge being an open sourced self-hosted system means that it may require some technical knowledge to set up and maintain, unlike those closed sourced SaaS solutions where you can simply sign up and start using it right away. But don't worry, the documentation is here to help you through the process. Feel free to take a look at the [Setup Guide](/getting-started/installation), and you will notice that it's not as hard as you think!

If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for help by either opening an issue on GitHub or by emailing me personally at melvinchia623600@gmail.com. I'll respond as soon as I can (usually will be really quick since I'm currently a university student with not much workload and plenty of free time).
